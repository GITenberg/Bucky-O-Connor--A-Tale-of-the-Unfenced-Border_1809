description: Questions of national sovereignty, immigration and cultural identity
  were as relevant in the era of the Wild West as they are today, if not more so.
  William MacLeod Raine's Bucky O'Connor broaches these tricky issues in the midst
  of a pleasing tale that unfolds in the classic Western tradition.
